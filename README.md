# FlightsGearAnomalyDetector

Semestrial project that Osher Elhadad and I have developed in Advanced Programing course at Bar-Ilan university.
It's an anomaly detector service for filght gear. The client can choose it's IO device (Socket\Command line) and acordingly provide the server with flight gear's stats and get it's anomalys.
The server runs on a diffrent therad which allows to deal with multiple clients simultaneously.
