# FlightsGearAnomalyDetector

An anomaly detector service for filght gear. Semestrial project that Osher Elhadad and I have developed in Advanced Programing course at Bar-Ilan university.
The client can choose it's IO device (Socket\Command line) and acordingly provide the server with flight gear's stats and get it's anomalys.
The server runs on a diffrent therad which allows to deal with multiple clients simultaneously.
