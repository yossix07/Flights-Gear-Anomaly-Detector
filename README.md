# FlightsGearAnomalyDetector

Simple and Hybrid anomaly detector for Advanced Programming 1 course at BIU, written in C++ with my partner Osher Elhadad.

This code includes: design patterns, polymorphism, STL and other C++ libraries, theading, TCP connection, and more..

This project is the server side for an anomaly detection service. given flight statistics, it can find anomalies using basic probability formulas.
In this project ,We have used threading in order to be able to handle a few clients.In addition, it is written using OOP and design patterns such as command and bridge, TCP communication, in which (using the strategy DP) the client can communicate with the server.
you can download the files and change the main to your wishes, and then run the main using an IDE or cmd.
